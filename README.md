== About == 
  The Owl Platform Solver C++ Libraries (lib-cppsolver) simplify writing
  solvers to interact with an Owl Platform/GRAIL RTLS system. These classes
  provide abstractions for interacting with both the aggregator and
  world model. Solvers can reason about information obtained from the
  aggregator or world model and then send that information to the world model.
